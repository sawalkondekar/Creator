how to send email or sms for all customers ? from Sidhant.
The content of the reply is as follows:
You can fetch the customer records and create a list of the emails to send to, it would look something like:
//
crRecord = Customer[ID in input.Customer_Lookup];
//
crEmailList = crRecord.Email_Field.getall();
crEmailString = crEmailList.tostring();
//
sendmail
[
      from: zoho.adminuserid
      to: zoho.adminuserid
      cc: crEmailString
      subject: "Some Subject"
      message: input.Message_Field
]
If you want to send to each customer individually you will need to iterate over the customer records, like:
//
for each crr in crRecord
{
      //
      sendmail
      [      
            from: zoho.adminuserid
            to: crRecord.Email_Field
            subject: "Some Subject"
            message: input.Message_Field    
      ]
}
Which SMS provider you use will determine how to send the SMS, if using Twilio there is the deluge integration function, see: https://www.zoho.com/deluge/help/twilio/send-sms.html
If some other provider you will need to send an API call using invokeUrl, see: https://www.zoho.com/deluge/help/webhook/invokeurl-api-task.html
