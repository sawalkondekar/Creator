// # Issue
- the attachment/ fun is not working suddenly. because User permissions has been changed

= So, for this - support reply are 

"Once the connection is created and authorized by a particular user, the data which are accesible to that user can be fetched using the connection.

It's possible that the permisson of that concerned developer was changed, which could have caused this problem (Edited)
It's better to use the super admin's authorization for such connections instead of developer's"

---
To prevent such instances, you can authorize the connection from the super admin or a administrator login.
