//How to hide fields in same form but in different report on edit

We cannot pass report_names to edit form scripts.
But you know the criteria for report 1 and report 2.
You have to do the same checks on Load script.
Example:
I have Status ( dropdown ) field in Task Form.
Report 1 - Open Tasks - Criteria => Status = Open
Report 2 - Closed Tasks - Criteria => Status = Closed
Assume Task form has field "Closed Comments", this should show only when edit button clicked from Closed Tasks.
You have to add script like this in "On Load - Edited" Script
if(Status == "Closed")
{
show Closed_Comments;
}
else
{
hide Closed_Comments;
}

Hope this helps :)
