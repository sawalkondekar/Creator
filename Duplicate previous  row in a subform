"On Add Row" of the workflow you could try something like:
//remember to change field/form names accordingly
counter = 0;
for each line in Subform_Field_Name
{
      counter = counter + 1;
      if counter > 0
      {
            row.Field_Name = line.Field_Name;
            row.Field_Name1 = line.Field_Name1;
            row.Field_Name2 = line.Field_Name2;
      }
}
This should update the new row with data from the previous row entered.
