The APIs to be used will be similar to the APIs in our documentation. In this file, we will let you know the additional nodes to be passed for batch lot tracking.

1. For enabling batch tracking for items: send the node as track_batch_number - Allowed values are true or false

2. For adding batches for In Entities such as Bills, POSITIVE Inventory Adjustment and Credit Notes: send the node as batches as shown below in each of the line items of the entity.
"line_items" : [
				{
				...
				"batches":[
				{
				"batch_in_id":9786328476798443, //Wont be available when you are saving for the first time but while updating, this id is necessary
				"batch_number":"Batch Reference Number",
				"external_batch_number":"Manufacturing Batch Number",
				"manufacturer_date":"2017-01-21",
				"expiry_date":"2018-01-21",
				"in_quantity":10
				},
				{
				"batch_in_id":9786328476798445,
				"batch_number":"Batch Reference Number2",
				"external_batch_number":"Manufacturing Batch Number2",
				"manufacturer_date":"2017-01-21",
				"expiry_date":"2018-01-18",
				"in_quantity":5
				}
				]
				...
				}
			]

3. For adding batches in Out Entities such as Invoices, NEGATIVE Inventory Adjustment and Debit Notes: send the node as batches as shown below in each of the line items of the entity.
"line_items" : [
				{
				...
				"batches":[
				{
				"batch_out_id":9786328476798443, //Wont be available when you are saving for the first time but while updating, this id is necessary
				"batch_in_id":9786328476798443,
				"out_quantity":10
				},
				{
				"batch_out_id":9786328476798446,
				"batch_in_id":9786328476798443,
				"out_quantity":5
				}
				]
				...
				}
			]

4. For adding opening stock for the items, send the node "batches" as shown in the In entities as an additional node in the item JSONString along with the track_batch_number node.

5. For Transfer Orders, send the node "batches" as shown below in each of the line items.
"line_items" : [
				{
				...
				"batches":[
				{
				"batch_in_number":"New Batch Reference number for this batch in the new warehouse",
				"batch_in_id":9786328476798443,
				"out_quantity":10
				},
				{
				"batch_in_number":"New Batch Reference number 2 for this batch in the new warehouse",
				"batch_in_id":9786328476798443,
				"out_quantity":5
				}
				]
				...
				}
			]

6. For fetching the Batches of an item.

Method : GET
Link : https://inventory.zoho.com/api/v1/items/batches?page=1&per_page=200&include_empty_batches=false&item_id=XXXX&warehouse_id=XXXX&organization_id=XXXX
warehouse_id is the unique ID generated by the system, it has to be used when you want to filter the batches from a particular warehouse.It is not mandatory when you are not using multiple warehouses in Inventory.Increase the page value for fetching more batches of the same item. Use include_empty_batches as true if you want to fetch the empty batches(already sold), else false.
